UCL CS is offering internships to gain skills and experience by supporting the teaching of a range of computer science modules.

The scheme is open to current UCL students who are second, third or fourth year undergraduates.

You need to be eligible to work in the UK during the period of the internship. If you are on a visa, your visa must
cover the full duration of the internship. UCL is unable to issue a visa for this scheme.
### Process

1. [Find a vacancy]() {TBC for 2023-24}.
2. Submit [an application form]() {TBC for 2023-24} for each vacancy you wish to apply for.
3. Wait to be contacted by the hiring module leader who will discuss your application with you.
4. The module leader will confirm if you are hired and the hours; or if you are not hired they will briefly give reasons
   why not.
5. If you are hired then **you** must 
   1. Create an account at [www.unitemps.com](https://portal.unitemps.com/register/candidate).
   2. Accept the assignment (a link will be sent to you by email).
   3. Complete a right to work (RTW) check with the Unitemps team before you can start working. You cannot undertake
      any work until the RTW has been checked.
   4. Complete a Payroll form from Unitemps with bank details and tax information.
6. Unitemps will provide you with information on how to complete timesheets to record your work. Timesheets will be
   authorised by the module leader.

### Roles
Typical roles are likely to include:

- providing support to students in programming labs
- providing drop-in style coding support
- mentoring or guiding small groups of students as they carry out projects

You must not participate in assessment related activities. Module leaders are aware of this and will not ask you to
carry out any assessment related activities.

### Support

The module leader will provide support and guidance to you during the internship.

All UCL internships should follow the guidelines given in
the [UCL internship policy](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/human-resources/internships-work-experience-and-volunteering-policy#definitions)
here.

### Hours

The hours required for each role are shown in the internship vacancy list.

Internships need to be taken outside of the timetabled course requirements and students will need to comply with
any [relevant visa regulations](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/immigration-and-visas/working-uk/working-during-your-studies).
