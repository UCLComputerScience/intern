# UCL CS Teaching Internship site


## About the GitHub pages

All files are in the **main** branch.

The site uses a modified version of the [jekyll minimal theme](https://github.com/pages-themes/hacker).

The page is visible at <https://uclcomputerscience.github.io/intern/>

## To edit an existing page

Edit the markdown file [index.md](index.md) in the root of the main branch. 

When you commit the change a GitHub Actions workflow runs that updates the web page.
